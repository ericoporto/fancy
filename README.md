# fancy

Fancy is a Script module for "fancy" text in Adventure Game Studio.

With Fancy you can have text with multiple colors, fonts, with sprites and other. It brings it's own Typed-Text mechanism and additional fancyness.

The cheatsheet of tags are below. Some tags are "solo", they don't require a closing tag.

- Color tag is `"[c:123]"` and `"[/c]"`, where `"123"` is an ags color.
- Font tag is `"[f:123]"` and `"[/f]"`, where `"123"` is an ags font index.
- Sprite tag is solo `"[s:123]`, where `"123"` is an ags sprite.

Note: use `"\n"` for linefeed, old lone `"["` ags linefeed is not supported.
